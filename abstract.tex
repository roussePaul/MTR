% What is an abstraction
%% finite representation of a complex system
%#### Begin directely with a finite abstraction and controller synthesis, I do not need further theory that I will not use. Just talk about the abstraction
%#### I need to begin with what I did: Formal methods applied to controller synthesis.
%## Take it slowly
%!!! Trop cat√©gorique
Formal controller synthesis methods intend to create controllers that verify properties for a given model. Most often, discrete abstractions of a continuous system are used in order to reduce the complexity of the problem.
%% Trop general
%As the model can be complex, it is often easier to use an abstraction of it.
If a behavioural relationship is met, then a valid controller for the abstraction will be valid as well for the system.
%% used later to generate finite state controller
The finiteness of the abstraction allows us to use computer science tools to synthesize a finite state controller (graphs search and fixed point algorithms, temporal logics).
%
% Why do we do it
%% automated framework
These methods are also called automated in a sense that finite state controllers can be automatically generated from high level specifications once the lowlevel controller and the environment discretization are given.
%% high level tasks (LTL specifications)

%--- --- --- Abstraction --- --- ---
% What abstraction did I use, How did I build it
%% past input memory used to compute reachable sets, discretize in the frame of the reached sets, do not discretize unsuefull information
In this work, we investigate abstractions with a state extended by $N$ memories of the last inputs.
Under some conditions, we have noticed that the inputs knowledge might be preferable over the full state observation,
%% only way to improve the reachibility property of the system is to discretize mores
%% efficient way to remove transient states of a stable behaviour of the system
%
%% More robust models
%
it has improved controllability of the system while keeping a low complexity of the abstraction.

% Non determinism
%% why it is not cool to have self loops
Resultant abstractions tends to create self-loops, this brought us to reconsider the planning algorithm but for non deterministic models.
Common least fixed point methods for non deterministic models where not usable: any cycle compromise the finite time reachability property.
%%% does not conserve the reachability properties (due to self loops)
To overcome this, we have been using a strong cyclic planning algorithm with a fairness function. This function indicate if the system will escape a cycle in finite time or can loop indefinitely.
%% how we can benefit from self loops (self loops make model smaller)
% Strong cyclic algorithm

% SML
%% Chosen model, double integrator
This controller synthesis method with Linear Temporal Logic specifications has been successfully used and tested on single and multiple quadricopters scenarios in the Smart Mobility Lab of KTH.
