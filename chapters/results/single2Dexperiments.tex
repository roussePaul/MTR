\section{Conclusion}
The strong cyclic planning method can be really effective in some case where the noise.

Conclude about when to use the strongly connected cyclic model.
How to choose the discretization.
Just accept the fact that there is no strong theoretical justifications?
Can I sort of generalize this method to a bigger class of model (not just the first integrator model)?

\comment{I must notice that the we are not using any optimal algorithm (DFS). This imply that the computing time are less than a relevant case scenario.}
