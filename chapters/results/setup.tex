\section{Setup}
We have been doing experiments with Iris Plus 3DR\trademark quadricopters in the testing environment of the Smart Mobility Lab of KTH.
The environment is a $5\times5$ meter based area of 2 meters high.
Position of the agents are measured with the motion capture Qualisys\trademark.
The computation of the discrete controller is done offline.
