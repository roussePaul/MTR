\section{Setup}
We have been doing experiments with Iris Plus 3DR\trademark quadricopters in the testing environment of the Smart Mobility Lab of KTH.
The environment is a $5\times5$ meter square area of 2 meters high.
Position of the agents are measured with the motion capture Qualisys\trademark.
The velocity feedback of the quadricopters is running on an offboard computer at 35Hz. The offboard controllers are using the ROS framework.
The computation of the discrete controller is done offline (see digram \ref{diagram}).
