%\subsection{Reduction}
%As it as been mentioned in the introduction, the "abstraction reduction" does not always create smaller abstractions.
%This depends on the type of inputs (discrete, continuous), the number of dimension of inputs, the dimension of the suppressed subspace of the state space and the initial discretization of it.

\subsection{Covering/Overlap in the state space}
When we replace the knowledge of part of the state by the estimation of the state based on inputs, there can be no equivalent discretization of the state space.
Mainly because 2 input sequences can produce reached sets that overlaps.
These overlap (see \ref{fig:overlapp}) cannot happened in discretization of the state space without any memory (the state is supposed to belong to one and only one observation).

We will see later that it can bring to improvement of the size of the abstraction in practice.

Self loops -not cool for multi agent task, lose the time information.
Abstractions of asymptotically stable system present a disadvantage on the multiagent control side, for some controls, if the state does not evolve any more, the abstraction will take self loops.
In term multi agent control this make the problem more complex as the control generation: self loops tend to create systems that are asynchronous with all the problems that might occurs because of this (basically one of the agent might be be stopped).

%TODO GRAPH TO SHOW IT (I can also do it for the second integrator)

%We will see that in some case it produce smaller abstraction.


\subsection{Reachability}
Reachable sets are computed with the invariant set. As the invariant set is an over approximation of the state,
\comment{less precise, volume successor bigger...}
 it is always possible to find a discretization of the unobserved subspace that create less successors than the estimation of the state.
This might results in an abstraction that is unusable whatever the number of memories we are using or the sampling rate of the model.

%\subsection{Notes}
%Self loops are not desirable.
%
%Self loops hide any time information (that is why I have been working on the time information chapter).
